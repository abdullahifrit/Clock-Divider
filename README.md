# Clock-Divider
A clock divider is like a magic box that takes a super fast ticking clock and gives you a slower ticking clock. It's like having a big cake (input clock) and slicing it into smaller pieces (output clock). Imagine you have a machine that counts the slices for you. You tell the machine how many slices you want, and it does the job.
